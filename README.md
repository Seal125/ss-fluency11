# Directions
More SQL fluency! Make sure you put the queries in the exercises file.

1. Create a new database `school`.

2. Make another table, `subjects`, that takes in an ID with a serial and a primary key, the subject name (such as Math or Science), and whether or not it's a STEM subject. Insert some subjects that you know, minimum of 5!

3. Create a new table, `students`, that takes in an ID with a serial and a primary key, a name, favorite subject that references the subject table's ID, and grade. Add a many students as you want, minimum of 5!

4. Add in a NOT NULL constraint to the `students` columns, except for favorite subject.

5. Write a query that shows which subject is the most favored by students.

6. Write a query that shows the number of subjects that are STEM, and the number of subjects that are not STEM.

7. In `students`, add a new column that displays their email.

8. Write a query that returns all the student emails who has a grade of your choice.

9. Write a query that returns the longest student name.

10. From the Launch School book, practice all the JOIN exercises, as those are also considered fluency! Build up the fluency for that!
